/**
 * A class that facilitates resolving a requestId to a network request. If the requestId does not resolve, a listener
 * is installed on the network request to wait for the request to appear. This is useful if an attempt to resolve the
 * requestId is made before the network request got reported.
 *
 * This functionality is intentionally provided in this class (instead of as part of NetworkLog) to enable clients
 * to control the duration of the wait and the lifetime of the associated promises by using the `clear` method on
 * this class.
