/**
 * If the LCP resource was an image, and that image was fetched over the
 * network, we want to be able to find the network request in order to construct
 * the critical path for an LCP image.
 * Within the trace file there are `LargestImagePaint::Candidate` events.
 * Within their data object, they contain a `DOMNodeId` property, which maps to
 * the DOM Node ID for that image.
 *
 * This id maps exactly to the `data.nodeId` property that a
 * `LargestContentfulPaint::Candidate` will have. So, when we find an image
 * paint candidate, we can store it, keying it on the node ID.
 * Then, when it comes to finding the network request for an LCP image, we can
 *
 * use the nodeId from the LCP candidate to find the image candidate. That image
 * candidate also contains a `imageUrl` property, which will have the full URL
 * to the image.
