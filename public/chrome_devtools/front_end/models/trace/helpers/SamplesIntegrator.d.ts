/**
 * This is a helper that integrates CPU profiling data coming in the
 * shape of samples, with trace events. Samples indicate what the JS
 * stack trace looked at a given point in time, but they don't have
 * duration. The SamplesIntegrator task is to make an approximation
 * of what the duration of each JS call was, given the sample data and
 * given the trace events profiled during that time. At the end of its
 * execution, the SamplesIntegrator returns an array of ProfileCalls
 * (under SamplesIntegrator::buildProfileCalls()), which
 * represent JS calls, with a call frame and duration. These calls have
 * the shape of a complete trace events and can be treated as flame
 * chart entries in the timeline.
 *
 * The approach to build the profile calls consists in tracking the
 * current stack as the following events happen (in order):
 * 1. A sample was done.
 * 2. A trace event started.
 * 3. A trace event ended.
 * Depending on the event and on the data that's coming with it the
 * stack is updated by adding or removing JS calls to it and updating
 * the duration of the calls in the tracking stack.
 *
 * note: Although this approach has been implemented since long ago, and
 * is relatively efficent (adds a complexity over the trace parsing of
 * O(n) where n is the number of samples) it has proven to be faulty.
 * It might be worthwhile experimenting with improvements or with a
 * completely different approach. Improving the approach is tracked in
 * crbug.com/1417439
