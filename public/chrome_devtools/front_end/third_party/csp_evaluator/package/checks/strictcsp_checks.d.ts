/**
 * @fileoverview Collection of "strict" CSP and backward compatibility checks.
 * A "strict" CSP is based on nonces or hashes and drops the allowlist.
 * These checks ensure that 'strict-dynamic' and a CSP nonce/hash are present.
 * Due to 'strict-dynamic' any allowlist will get dropped in CSP3.
 * The backward compatibility checks ensure that the strict nonce/hash based CSP
 * will be a no-op in older browsers by checking for presence of 'unsafe-inline'
 * (will be dropped in newer browsers if a nonce or hash is present) and for
 * prsensence of http: and https: url schemes (will be droped in the presence of
 * 'strict-dynamic' in newer browsers).
