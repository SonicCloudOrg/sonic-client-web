     * We always need to profile against the DevTools root target, which is
     * the target that DevTools is attached to.
     *
     * In most cases, this will be the tab that DevTools is inspecting.
     * Now pre-rendering is active, tabs can have multiple pages - only one
     * of which the user is being shown. This is the "primary page" and hence
     * why in code we have "primaryPageTarget". When there's a prerendered
     * page in a background, tab target would have multiple subtargets, one
     * of them being primaryPageTarget.
     *
     * The problems with using primary page target for tracing are:
     * 1. Performance trace doesn't include information from the other pages on
     *    the tab which is probably not what the user wants as it does not
     *    reflect reality.
     * 2. Capturing trace never finishes after prerendering activation as
     *    we've started on one target and ending on another one, and
     *    tracingComplete event never gets processed.
     *
     * However, when we want to look at the URL of the current page, we need
     * to use the primaryPageTarget to ensure we get the URL of the tab and
     * the tab's page that is being shown to the user. This is because the tab
     * target (which is what rootTarget is) only exposes the Target and Tracing
     * domains. We need the Page target to navigate as it implements the Page
     * domain. That is why here we have to store both.
